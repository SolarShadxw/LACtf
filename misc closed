This file is in regards to the LACTF challenge titled MISC/Closed 

![The Png file](1D8CF3F1-0427-4ED2-86C0-E40A064D5345 (1).png)

First things first we have to actually look at the file (duh ikr) 
Things we can notice, that can prove to be useful in the image include: 
 - Part of California State Parks 
 - Has a closed area 
 - Sensitive Wildlife Area 
 - Area has shorebirds 

All of these things can narrow our search down 
However after looking longer I saw a trail marker, or at least a partial one with the name "..Shore Trail"

Another detail that was key to solving where this picture is located was the small detail of the water

This was more personal experience (shoutout geoguesser) as the water looked like, you guessed it, water like you would see on the 
shore of the Pacific. This might not seem all too important but it considering just how many state parks there 
are in Claifornia this ended up helping a lot. 

Now we are taking all of these clues and utilizing it. Firstly I started off with state parks on the coastline 
This following site seemed like a good starting point: https://www.timeout.com/california/things-to-do/best-california-state-parks 

While scanning through the parks, some of them didnt have rock formations like we could see in the picture
