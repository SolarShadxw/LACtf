First things first we have to actually look at the file (duh ikr) 
Things we can notice, that can prove to be useful in the image include: 
 - Part of California State Parks 
 - Has a closed area 
 - Sensitive Wildlife Area 
 - Area has shorebirds 

All of these things can narrow our search down 
However after looking longer I saw a trail marker, or at least a partial one with the name "..Shore Trail"

Another detail that was key to solving where this picture is located was the small detail of the water

This was more personal experience (shoutout geoguesser) as the water looked like, you guessed it, water like you would see on the 
shore of the Pacific. This might not seem all too important but it considering just how many state parks there 
are in California this ended up helping a lot. 

Now we are taking all of these clues and utilizing it. Firstly I started off with state parks on the coastline 
This following site seemed like a good starting point: https://www.timeout.com/california/things-to-do/best-california-state-parks 

While scanning through the parks, some of them didnt have rock formations like we could see in the picture

Eventually I came across good ol Point Lobo, where a big indicator was that it was known for its coastline trails 
So off we got to consult google maps, and scanning the area for a formation as seen in the picture 

AND BOOM, there is a rock formation that looks just like the one we need, and zooming in we see that the color matches as well 
After some more confirmations, and looking around some more, I tapped on the bottom left corner twice to pull up precise lat and longitudes
AAAAAnd it didnt work. How could this be? I rounded to the thousandths... 

And here is where the magic happens, the key with challenges is reading. 

I had a space after the comma. Womp Womp 

And there we go, we ended up with the flag being flag(36.516,-121.949)
